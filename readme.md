# Kali setup tooling

Because I'm lazy and need to setup kali machines frequently
Because I like to have my work environment the same every time
Because I like to document the tools I use

We have this set of scripts, which facilitates setting up a fresh VM without the hassle of doing everything manually

## Usage

Run this line: 

```bash
cd ~/ && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bramvandenbussche/kali-setup/master/start.sh && chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh
```
